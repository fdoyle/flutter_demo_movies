NB: I'm mostly happy with the result, but I also have a hunch there might be a more idiomatic way to do this. It seems like you should be able to do something like this with slivers or pageview transforms, but the more I read the docs on both, the more it felt like I'd be better off doing it with more "fundamental" widgets. 

ha, looks like this pattern is getting popular.
